# TU Delft DSAIT4005 MDL Assignments

This repository contains assignments for the course **DSAIT4005 Machine and Deep Learning** in TU Delft, a newly formed course derived from the original **CS4220 Machine Learning 1** and **CS4240 Deep Learning**. The course covers a wide range of topics in machine learning and deep learning, providing both theoretical and practical insights into these fields.


Each assignment folder includes three files:
- `Assignment_*_template.ipynb`: The starter notebook, provided as a blank template for students to complete.
- `Assignment_*.ipynb`: The primary notebook file, with my own completed solution.
- `Assignment_*_SOLUTIONS.ipynb`: A reference solution with completed answers, for comparison and review.
